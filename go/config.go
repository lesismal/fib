// TaskPool runs the rounds the event loop schedules. *taskpool.TaskPool
// implements it; set Config.TaskPool to supply a different one.
//
// Each task must eventually run exactly once. GoTasks accepts a prefix of its
// argument and reports how long that prefix is; the engine closes the
// connections of the tasks it did not accept, so a pool that is stopping may
// refuse work, but one that is merely busy should queue it rather than refuse.
// A task may block for as long as the handler it calls does, so a pool that
// runs tasks on a fixed set of goroutines bounds how many connections progress
// at once.

// PoolSizing is how many workers a task pool may run and how many tasks it may
// hold waiting for them. MaxEvents also sizes the epoll batch the event loop
// collects in one round.

// Pools are oversubscribed relative to the cores they run on, because a worker
// drives its connection's read and write syscalls itself and so spends much of
// a round inside the kernel rather than on a P. Sizing a pool to GOMAXPROCS
// leaves cores idle whenever its workers are in flight.
//
// How far to oversubscribe depends on the mode, because the worker count does
// not mean the same thing in both.
//
// ModeCond creates every worker up front and parks it on a condition variable,
// so the count is a population of goroutines that exists whether or not there
// is work, and paying for more of them than the load needs makes the scheduler
// move more goroutines between the same cores. A 100k-connection echo run
// measured, on a five-core cpuset: 255k echoes/s with 16 workers, 319k with 64,
// 331k with 250, 350k with 500, then back down to 340k with 2000 and 314k with
// 5000.
//
// ModeElastic forks a worker per submission while it has capacity and retires
// it after a short idle linger, so the count is a ceiling instead of a
// population: raising it costs nothing until the load actually climbs to it,
// and lowering it throttles a burst that the cores could have absorbed. Its
// default is therefore an order of magnitude higher than the cond one.
//
// Its floor follows the cores rather than GOMAXPROCS, since the ceiling is
// sized from GOMAXPROCS and the floor is what keeps a lowered GOMAXPROCS from
// throttling the pool below what the machine's cores can keep busy. It is
// elasticMinWorkersPerCPU workers per core, where a fixed floor would hand a
// two-core machine 5000 workers per core.
//
// ModeAdaptive keeps parked workers the way ModeCond does but grows and shrinks
// the population with the load, so its count is a ceiling as under
// ModeElastic, and it takes the same default. The floor it retires down to is
// Config.MinWorkerCount.
//
// Note that every pool needs a GOMAXPROCS above the core count to pay off,
// since its workers hold their P while they are in a syscall. See the note on
// GOMAXPROCS in README.zh-CN.md: the same run went from 330k to 415k echoes/s,
// and from 55k to 71k accepted connections/s, on GOMAXPROCS alone.

	//
	// The two pools do different work. An engine worker holds its connection
	// for one round: it reads the socket, hands what came in to the protocol,
	// and gives the round back, so the work is bounded by the syscalls it
	// makes. A handler runs the application, which may wait on a database, a

	// connection has one round. Sizing the handler pool like the engine's
