// "udp", "udp4", "udp6" or "unix" (empty means "tcp"), and addr is
// "host:port", or for "unix" the socket's path. A UDP
// dial connects its socket to addr, so the connection exchanges datagrams with
// that peer alone: each Send is one datagram and each OnData one received. A host that is not an IP
// literal is resolved on a goroutine of its own, so Dial never waits on DNS.
// A timeout of zero leaves the connect to the operating system's own timeout.
//
// When the connect succeeds, the handler's OnOpen runs first and then done
// with the connection. When it fails or times out, done runs with a nil
// connection and a *net.OpError, and the handler hears nothing. Either way done
// runs exactly once, on the event loop, so like OnOpen it must not block. It
// may be nil.

// that the dial cannot start: an unknown network, a malformed or unresolvable
