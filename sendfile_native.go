// SendFile sends count bytes of f, starting at offset, after whatever was
// sent before it and ahead of whatever is sent after. On Linux and macOS the
// bytes go from the file to the socket by sendfile(2), without passing
// through user space; on Windows they are read a chunk at a time as the
// socket takes them. Either way the file is read only as the peer keeps up,
// so a large file costs no more memory than a small one.
//
// The connection sends from its own duplicate of f's descriptor, so the
// caller may close f as soon as SendFile returns. The file must hold the
// whole range: a file that turns out shorter closes the connection, since the
// peer was promised count bytes.
//
// A connection with a layer, such as TLS, cannot hand the file to the kernel,
// since the layer has to transform its bytes: the range is read and sent
// through the layer before SendFile returns.
